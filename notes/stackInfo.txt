How the stack works:

Each block will add a onto the stack.
Format is as follows

[temp memory]
[...]
[temp memory]
[local varialbes]
[...]
[local variables]
[passed params]
[...]
[pased params]
[frame pointers]
[...]
[frame pointers]
[goto address]
[return value]


temp memory is used for calulating equations.
The symbol table has a popTemp, pushTemp, getTemp and getCurrentTempAddress to interact with temp variables

The main memory will start with

[...]
[heap memory]
[current frame pointer]
