Ben, Steven, and Hezekiah are going to make a computer language. It will have syntax similar to c but will be a little more abstract. It will be statically typed and won't natively support objects. However, we are planning on creating a dictionary that behaves similarily to a class in javascript. The compiler will be written in java which Steven and Ben are already familiar with. 

Currently, our plan is for the compiler to consist of three stages. Tokenizer, Parser, Generation. The tokenizer will create an array of tokens from a string. The Parser will create and abstract syntax tree using a handwritten recursive descent parser. The Generator will create bytecode that can then be read by a seperate program.
